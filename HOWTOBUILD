Dependencies:
* Build https://github.com/ncsu-samatova/Timer.git somewhere
* Build https://github.com/ncsu-samatova/PForDelta.git somewhere

When you first check out ALACRITY:
1. Edit ./myrunconf, setting the paths for timer and indexcompression, and your output build path
2. Run ./myrunconf

After that, to rebuild any time:
1. Run make; make install
2. (optional) Run make check to build the test programs

If you change configure.ac or any Makefile.am:
1. Make sure you're on a system with modern autotools
2. Build as usual (make; make install)
3. Be sure to commit configure and all Makefile.in's, as well as the modified configure.ac and/or Makefile.am's

If the build scripts get messed up somehow:
1. Make sure you're on a system with modern autotools
2. Run autoreconf -i --force
3. Do the steps under "When you first check out ALACRITY:"
4. Do the steps under "If you change configure.ac or any Makefile.am:"

---- OLD ----
Manual guide (old, don't use this):
Step 1: Run "autoreconf -i"
Step 2: Check out and build <SVN>/systems/software/timer and <SVN>/systems/branches/saurabh/indexcompression somewhere
Step 3: Run "./configure" with the following flags:
* --with-timer=<absolute path to timer build dir (the directory containing lib/ and include/>
* --with-ridcompress=<absolute path Saurabh's compression lib (this is the source directory currently)>
* --prefix=<absolute path to where to install ALACRITY>
Step 4: Run "make; make install"
Step 5 (optional): Run "make check" to build tests
Note: You should only have to do Steps 1-3 once; Step 4 *should* rerun ./configure etc. as needed automatically
